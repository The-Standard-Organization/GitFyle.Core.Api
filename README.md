## Introduction
`LET YOUR CODE DO THE TALKING`

- This platform is built to enable others to see your true value based on your code and your code alone. Nothing else matters.

GitFyle is an opportunity for you, me and every other engineer around the world to take control of their craft.

To better understand where you are, and give you the compass to show you where to head, and to achieve true meaningful growth. But even more importantly,
help others understand your true genius, and hire you or reward you according to your real skills. No matter where you are or who you are. 
No matter what your background is, or however many years of experience you have.

## What is GitFyle.Core.Api?
GitFyle.Core.Api is the core API for the GitFyle platform. It is the newly re-engineered future version of the original [GitFyle(beta)](https://gitfyle.com/about). 

## Standard-Compliance
This library was built according to The Standard. The library follows engineering principles, patterns and tooling as recommended by The Standard.

This library is also a community effort which involves many hours of pair-programming, test-driven development and in-depth exploration, research, and design discussions.

## Standard-Promise
The most important fulfillment aspect in a Standard complaint system is aimed towards contributing to people, its evolution, and principles.
An organization that systematically honors an environment of learning, training, and sharing knowledge is an organization that learns from the past, makes calculated risks for the future, 
and brings everyone within it up to speed on the current state of things as honestly, rapidly, and efficiently as possible. 
 
We believe that everyone has the right to privacy, and will never do anything that could violate that right.
We are committed to writing ethical and responsible software, and will always strive to use our skills, coding, and systems for the good.
We believe that these beliefs will help to ensure that our software(s) are safe and secure and that it will never be used to harm or collect personal data for malicious purposes.
 
The Standard Community as a promise to you is in upholding these values.
